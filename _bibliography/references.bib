  abstract = {Synthetic data has been more and more used in the last few years. While its applications are various, measuring its utility and privacy is seldom an easy task. Since there are different methods of evaluating these issues, which are dependent on data types, use cases and purpose, a generic method for evaluating utility and privacy does not exist at the moment. So, we introduced a compilation of the most recent methods for evaluating privacy and utility into a single executable in order to create a report of the similarities and potential privacy breaches between two datasets, whether it is related to synthetic or not. We catalogued 24 different methods, from qualitative to quantitative, column-wise or table-wise evaluations. We hope this resource can help scientists and industries get a better grasp of the synthetic data they have and produce more easily and a better basis to create a new, more broad method for evaluating dataset similarities.},

  abstract = {In healthcare facilities, processes are not always carried out under the expected methods. The variation in practice leads to lesser quality treatments and greater costs. Within a single visit, patients are now likely to interact with multiple departments, healthcare providers, and Health Information Systems (HIS). Because of these events, information is frequently dispersed, not normalized, and incoherent, creating several barriers to overview processes and audit their quality. Process mining can be a useful tool for getting over some of these obstacles. We designed a procedure to automatically apply process mining techniques using the HL7 standard, which is used for exchanging information between HIS as a source of event logs. Our work provides a way for pooling HL7 messages from a unified repository of a healthcare institution and provides a pipeline to apply process mining methods to create insights relative to the healthcare processes that are implemented. We show a few diagrams to demonstrate the tool's potential as a process formalization and analysis tool. We concluded that using HL7 messages as a proxy for processes that involve several HIS is a way to easily provide process mining capabilities to an organization.},

  abstract = {Data is a major asset in today's healthcare scenery. Hospitals are one of the primary producers of healthcare-related data and the value this data can provide is enormous. However, to use this to improve healthcare practice and push science forward, it is necessary to safeguard the patient's privacy and the ethical use of the data. The ethical and legal requirements are vast and complex. Synthetic data appears as a tool to overcome these hurdles and provide fast and reliable access to data without compromising utility nor privacy. Even though Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are receiving a lot of attention lately, the application of most common models and architectures are not suited to tabular data \textendash{} the most prevalent healthcare-related data. This study surveys the current GAN implementations tailored to this scenario. The analysis was focused mainly on the models employed, datasets used, and metrics reported regarding the quality of the generated data in terms of utility, privacy and how they compare among themselves. We aim to help institutions and investigators get a grasp of the tools to facilitate access to healthcare data, as well as recommendations for testing data synthesizers with privacy concerns.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The domain of Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) lies in the intersection of multiple disciplines, making it difficult to define and, consequently, characterise the workforce, training needs and requirements in this domain. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there isn't any aggregated information about the higher education programmes in BMHI currently being delivered in Portugal, and which knowledge, skills, and competencies these programmes aim to develop. AIM: Our aim is to map BMHI teaching in Portugal. More specifically, our objective is to identify and characterise the: a.) programmes delivering relevant BMHI teaching; b.) geographical distribution and chronological evolution of such programmes; and c.) credit distribution and weight. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study to systematically identify all programmes currently delivering any core BMHI modules in Portugal. Our population included all graduate-level programmes being delivered in the 2021/2022 academic year in any Portuguese higher education institution. RESULTS: We identified 23 programmes delivering relevant teaching in BMHI in Portugal. Of these, eight (35\%) were classified as dedicated educational programmes in BMHI, mostly delivered in polytechnic institutes at a master's level (5; 63\%) and located preferentially in the northern part of the country (7). Currently, there are four programmes with potential for accreditation but still requiring some workload increase in certain areas in order to be eligible.},
