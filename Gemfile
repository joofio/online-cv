# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# gem "minima", "~> 2.5.1"
#gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
#gem "liquid", "~> 4.0.4"
gem "faraday-retry"

# If you have any plugins, put them here!

end

# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
#platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
#  gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
#  gem "tzinfo-data"
