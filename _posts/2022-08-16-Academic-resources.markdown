Grad students are often confronted with a great task in order to finish their thesis. From writing our thesis, keeping up with the state-of-the-art of our areas. Publishing quality content, with text, images and tables with industry-grade quality while managing to balance all of this into tight schedules is hard work. This is especially important at the PhD level where it takes several years of this way of life.

So, in order to to help every student out there, I have compiled a few tools that were/are handy for such cases.
I have two different approaches. A single list with a lot of resources and a workflow for reading papers, annotating them and creating a map of the notes with the annotations taken from the papers.


So I have created this [list](https://github.com/joofio/awesome-academic-resources).

In this, there are a few groups of tools:
- Bibliography Manager / referencing
- Brain Management
- Paper and Journals Evaluation / Discovery
- Better Writing
- Systematic Review
- Image Creation
- Monitoring
- Text Editors
- Presentations
- Open Data


Feel free to comment and add stuff.
